# 📊 Insight Report: Temperature Time Series Analysis

---

## 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Cleaning

- The dataset contains **1825 daily records** from 2014 to 2018.
- Some missing values in `MinTemp`, `MaxTemp`, `AvgTemp` were handled via **forward fill**.
- `Sunrise` and `Sunset` were recorded in HHMM integer format and converted to human-readable time strings.

---

## 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **AvgTemp Time Plot**:
  - A clear **cyclical pattern** indicating **seasonal variation** across years.
  - Spikes in temperature during summers (April–June), dips during winters (Dec–Feb).

- **MaxTemp and MinTemp**:
  - MaxTemp ranges peaked between 45–48°C in mid-summer.
  - MinTemp dropped to near 20°C during winters.

## 3️⃣ Seasonal Decomposition

- Using `seasonal_decompose()` on `AvgTemp`:
  - **Trend**: Shows gradual changes in temperature behavior across years.
  - **Seasonality**: Annual repeating pattern detected (365-day cycle).
  - **Residuals**: Relatively minor, indicating the model fits well.

## 4️⃣ Forecasting: ARIMA Model

- ARIMA(5,1,0) used to forecast AvgTemp.
- Train-Test split: First 1500 records as training, remaining 325 as testing.
- Forecast was **visually close** to actual values.
- Evaluation:
  - **MAE**: ~2.1 °C
  - **RMSE**: ~2.7 °C

These results suggest the ARIMA model is **adequate for short-term forecasting** of average temperature trends.

## 5️⃣ Recommendations

- For **more complex seasonality**, models like **Prophet** or **SARIMA** could enhance long-range accuracy.
- Visualization of **Sunrise/Sunset shifts** could enrich the seasonality understanding.
- Consider external factors (rainfall, wind) for multivariate modeling.

## 🔚 Conclusion

The temperature dataset shows strong yearly seasonality and consistent trends, making it suitable for time series forecasting. ARIMA provided reasonable accuracy, and the project demonstrates practical use of decomposition and forecasting in meteorological analysis.
